# Two Pointers — Problem List

This repository collects Two Pointers pattern problems that I'm solving to practice the technique.

Only three fields are tracked for each problem:
- Question: the problem title (with problem number).
- Link: URL to the problem (LeetCode or other).
- Done: a checkbox you can update to mark the problem as solved. Replace `[ ]` with `[x]` when done.

If you want to order or group problems differently, feel free to edit this file.

## How to use

- To mark a problem as solved, edit this file and change the corresponding `Done` cell from `[ ]` to `[x]`.
- You can also add notes or a link to your solution file next to the problem if you want to keep track of implementations.

Happy practicing the Two Pointers pattern!
